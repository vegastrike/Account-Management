Account Management
==================

This repository contains functionality for the original multi-player capabilities
of the Vega Strike Engine. As this functionality was incomplete and buggy it
was removed from the current Vega Strike Engine while the team brings the engine
back up to par and under full maintenance and enhancement.

The functionality provided here will probably be implemented very differently
by the time the team returns to the multi-player aspect if for no other reason
than that times, tools, technology, and standards change. For instance, the
team shouldn't be taking on Account Authentication as there are already good
tools that implement Web-based Identities that could be utilized instead.

Therefore, to preserve the historical record this repository has been archived.
